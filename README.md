Chat, Shop, Watch, Own, Exist.

Footnotes:

Out of all 3 components of a super app, i.e chat, media and commerce.
Chat is something that we have to demonopolize immediately, for a community-owned public infrastructure to exist the communication layer has to be the strongest.

Please follow the repository for more updates as they happen. This is a build in public project, as the project gets into build mode. You should be receving updates daily on all socials.
